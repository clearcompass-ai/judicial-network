FILE PATH: api/middleware/mtls.go

DESCRIPTION:
    mTLS Authenticator. Reads the verified peer certificate from the
    TLS connection and extracts the callerDID from a SAN URI of the
    form did:*. The TLS handshake (already enforced by the listener
    when ClientCAFile is configured at the composer) proves control
    of the cert's private key; this middleware just lifts the proven
    identity into the request context.

    Wire format pinned: cert MUST have at least one URI SAN whose
    string starts with "did:". The first did:-prefixed URI wins. No
    other SAN type (DNS, email, IP) is consulted — DIDs are
    URI-shaped and the cert MUST encode them in the URI SAN per
    RFC 5280 §4.2.1.6.

    Failure modes (all → 401, no body):
      - No TLS connection (running plain HTTP behind a TLS-terminating
        proxy without forwarded cert headers)
      - No verified peer cert (handshake didn't complete or
        ClientAuth is not RequireAndVerifyClientCert)
      - Verified cert has no DID-shaped URI SAN

    Composer responsibility: the listener MUST be TLS-enabled with
    tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert. api/server.go's NewServer takes
    care of this when ClientCAFile is set on Config. Middleware here
    assumes the TLS layer already verified the cert chain.

    Today this middleware shares semantics with
    api/exchange/auth/mtls.ExtractDIDFromCert. We keep the two
    distinct because the existing function lives in a per-handler
    auth package whose lifecycle is tied to api/exchange specifically;
    Phase 5 here is composer-level. They can converge in a future
    cleanup once api/exchange/auth.SignerAuth is fully retired.
