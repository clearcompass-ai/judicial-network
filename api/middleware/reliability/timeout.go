/*
FILE PATH: api/middleware/reliability/timeout.go

DESCRIPTION:
    Per-handler request timeout. Wraps next with http.TimeoutHandler
    so a slow upstream / runaway handler cannot pin a goroutine + a
    response writer indefinitely. Returns 503 Service Unavailable
    (with the message "request timeout") when the handler doesn't
    finish in time.

    Default 30s matches the operator's submit deadline so a slow
    operator surfaces as a clean 503 to the caller rather than as
    an indefinitely-hung connection.

    The wrapper is stacked at the composer level (after auth) so
    every route gets the timeout uniformly. Handlers that need a
    longer cap (bulk paths) opt in by registering a per-route wrap.

// RequestTimeout wraps next with http.TimeoutHandler. timeout
// <= 0 disables the wrapper (use only in tests + bulk paths).

// The 503 body is intentionally short — production deploys MUST
// NOT leak handler-internal context into a timeout response.
