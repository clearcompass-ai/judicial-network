// FILE PATH: verification/witness_set_registry.go
//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
//	WitnessSetRegistry is the live, concurrency-safe holder for the per-
//	source-log *cosign.WitnessKeySet map that cross-log verification reads.
//	It is the single most trust-sensitive object in the inbound-gossip
//	pipeline: the witness sets ARE the root of trust against which every
//	pulled CosignedTreeHead / equivocation / escrow-override finding is
//	checked. Reads (Snapshot/Get) feed VerificationContext; the single write
//	path (ApplyRotation) swaps a set ONLY after the rotation cryptographically
//	verifies against the CURRENTLY-trusted set.
//
//	ZERO-TRUST INVARIANTS:
//	  - Verify-before-swap: ApplyRotation runs witness.VerifyRotation against
//	    the current set; an unverifiable rotation never mutates trust.
//	  - Monotonic: witness.VerifyRotation pins the rotation to the current
//	    set's hash, so a stale or replayed rotation (or one targeting a
//	    superseded set) is rejected — trust cannot be reverted to an older or
//	    compromised set.
//	  - No peer input to the threshold: the new set's quorum K is a caller-
//	    supplied governance decision (cryptography proves WHO signed, never
//	    HOW MANY must).
//
//	Seeded at boot from crosslog.BuildWitnessSets; mutated only by the gossip
//	reconciler acting on a verified WitnessRotationFinding.
