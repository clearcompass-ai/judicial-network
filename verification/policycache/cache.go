DESCRIPTION:

	Minimal TTL cache used by JN's read-time policy enforcement to
	absorb repeat lookups against the ledger's read-side query
	endpoints (cosignature_of, delegate_did). Per the v1.5.1 design
	matrix, "JN owns its own projection + TTL — NOT ledger code":
	the ledger is the authoritative source; consumers pick caching
	policy per workload.

	# SHAPE

	One generic TTL map keyed by string, holding any value type via
	a per-entry expiry. Lazy eviction on access — no goroutine, no
	mutex contention from a sweeper.

	Two workloads share this primitive:

	  * Historical verification (long-running queries against
	    finalized data): TTL on the order of minutes is fine —
	    the underlying ledger entries are immutable.
	  * Real-time gate (admission-time decisions where staleness
	    matters): seconds-level TTL keeps the cache useful for
	    burst traffic without serving stale view of a freshly-
	    delegated authority.

	The cache does NOT subscribe to ledger invalidation events
	(the ledger's gossip layer is its own concern); freshness is
	bounded by TTL alone.

	# NOT A PRODUCTION-GRADE LRU

	No size cap, no LRU eviction. Sized for JN's expected key
	space (active delegations per network: low-thousands; recent
	primary entries with cosignatures: low-tens-per-minute). Add
	a size cap when measured working-set demands it.

KEY DEPENDENCIES:
  - stdlib sync, time. No SDK or framework couplings.
